  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="intro-container">
    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>Hey there! I’m Pihu Agarwal, a Computer Science major, RA in Robinson Hall, and certified sitcom binger (Friends is my comfort show, obviously). Even though I’m more of an introvert, I love helping people feel at home, which is exactly what being an RA lets me do. Sometimes it’s the quiet listeners who create the coziest spaces.

College, to me, is more than just assignments and exams. It’s about all the little moments of growth outside the classroom. As an RA, that means balancing challenges and support (like Sanford’s theory), whether it’s calming down a roommate squabble or cheering someone through homesickness.

When I’m not on RA duty or coding away, you’ll probably catch me building Legos, dancing, or curled up with a good book. Basically, I like to keep my life equal parts creative, nerdy, and fun.</p>

<section id="what-is-ra">
  <h2>What is an RA?</h2>
  <p>An RA is someone who creates a safe, welcoming environment where students can truly feel at home. I just want to say be someone that makes a space where everyone feels comfortable to come back to after a hard day. I've had bad roommate experiences in the past 2 years where I started to feel uncomfortable to even enter the room so I would stay out late everyday and come back after my roommate was sleeping. These dorms are the students' home away from home and I want to protect that. As an RA, I see myself as a bridge between students and campus resources, someone who listens without judgment and helps navigate the challenges of college life. My goal is to ensure that every resident knows they have someone in their corner, ready to support them through both the exciting and difficult moments of their college journey.</p>
</section>

<section id="community-builders">
  <h2>Community Builders</h2>
  <p>Community Builders are essential because they transform a group of strangers living in the same building into a genuine community. I hosted game night in the dorm. Initially I lured people in with the free food and drinks but it was a fun night of bonding and laughter when some residents decided to sit. A lot of RAs from the supergroup showed too and it was a great bonding activity for the supergroup too. Through these events, I hope my residents gain lasting friendships, a sense of belonging, and memories that make their college experience truly special.</p>

<section id="personal-mission">
  <h2>Personal Mission & Values</h2>
  <p>My core mission is to create inclusive spaces where every individual feels valued, heard, and empowered to be their authentic self. I believe in the power of empathy, active listening, and leading by example. My values center around fairness, kindness, and growth - both personal and communal. I strive to be the kind of leader who doesn't just enforce rules, but builds genuine connections that help students thrive academically, socially, and personally. Every interaction is an opportunity to make someone's day a little brighter and their path a little clearer.</p>

<section id="self-understanding">
  <h2>How my themes relate to how I understand myself</h2>
  <div class="intro-container">
    <div class="intro-text">
      <p><strong>Harmony:</strong> I see myself as someone who naturally seeks peace and common ground, even if it means putting aside my own strong opinions.</p>
      <p><strong>Intellection:</strong> I know I'm energized by thinking deeply and taking time to process ideas before speaking.</p>
      <p><strong>Analytical:</strong> I often question the "why" behind things and rarely accept surface-level answers.</p>
      <p><strong>Consistency:</strong> I thrive on routines and fairness. I feel most comfortable when expectations are clear and everyone is treated equally.</p>
      <p><strong>Adaptability:</strong> I work best under pressure, preferring to respond to situations as they come rather than over-planning.</p>

<section id="benefits">
  <h2>Benefits</h2>
  <p>During a heated call about noise complaints, my Harmony helped me see what everyone had in common, wanting a comfortable living environment. My Analytical nature led me to ask questions that helped residents notice new perspectives they hadn't considered. Using Intellection, I listened deeply and asked follow-up questions that led to a common ground. My Consistency ensured everyone got equal speaking time and fair treatment. When the discussion took unexpected turns with the residents yelling at each other, my Adaptability helped me go with the flow and adjust the meeting structure. The result was a roommate agreement that addressed everyone's concerns while building stronger relationships between residents.</p>
</section>

<section id="challenges">
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>On my first on-call shift, I found a drunk resident passed out in the bathroom. My Analytical side immediately wanted all the facts before acting, while Intellection made me overthink every decision rather than responding quickly. Harmony prevented me from "creating a scene," and Consistency had me worried about fair treatment rather than immediate safety. My Adaptability kept adjusting responses instead of following protocol. Fortunately, I overcame these paralysis moments by relying on my co-RA by using Harmony who helped me focus. We called campus police and the coordinator on call. The resident received proper medical attention, and everyone had a safe night.This taught me to not overthink and use my strengths to my advantage.</p>
